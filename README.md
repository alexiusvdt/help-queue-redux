# In this repo:

# Adding Redux Store 

  * import `{createStore} from redux and `reducer` from src
  * create the `store` const
  * import `{ Provider }` from react-redux

## Coursework links

This project contains all the code from the LearnHowToProgram.com [Section 2: React Fundamentals](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/react/react-fundamentals) coursework in which we created a Help Queue application in [React.js](https://reactjs.org/). 

It is meant to be used as a starter repo to continue the Help Queue project in three separate learning sections of [the _React_ course](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/react) on LearnHowToProgram.com: 

* Section 3 "React with Redux", starting in the lesson titled ["Setting up Our First Redux Project"](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/react/react-with-redux/setting-up-our-first-project).
* Section 4 "React with NoSQL", starting in the lessons titled ["Refactoring Help Queue to Use Hooks"](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/react/react-with-nosql/refactoring-help-queue-to-use-hooks).
* Section 5 "React with APIs", starting in the lesson title ["React Context"](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/react/react-with-apis/react-context)
